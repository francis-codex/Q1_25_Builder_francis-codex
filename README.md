Welcome to my repository!

This repository contains various projects and code snippets that I worked on while learning/building on the Solana Ecosystem.

Each folder contains specific examples and implementations related to Solana development, including wallet management, smart contracts, Programs, token minting, NFT creation, etc.

Please, don't hesitate to drop some comments, open issues, follow, or contribute.
